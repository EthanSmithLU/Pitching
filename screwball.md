# Screwball

The screwball is a rare and unconventional pitch in baseball, known for its unique movement that breaks in the opposite direction of most breaking pitches. It is thrown with a special grip and arm action that causes the ball to move down and in toward a same-handed batter, making it particularly effective against opposite-handed hitters.

## Movement Profile

- Features a downward and inward movement toward same-handed batters
- Moves in the opposite direction of a slider or curveball
- The break is usually sharp, with late movement that can confuse hitters

## Velocity Ranges

- **Major League average**: 65-75 mph
- **Slower screwballs**: 60-64 mph
- **Faster screwballs**: 76-80 mph

## Usage

- Effective against opposite-handed batters due to the inward movement
- Can be used as an off-speed pitch to disrupt timing
- Often employed as a strikeout pitch, especially when ahead in the count
- Less commonly used than other breaking pitches, making it an element of surprise

## Grip

- Gripped with the index and middle fingers placed together on the outside of the ball
- The thumb is placed underneath, with the pinky and ring fingers stabilizing the ball
- Thrown with a pronation of the wrist (rotating the hand inward) at release, which gives the ball its unique spin and movement
- The pronation creates a spin that causes the ball to move in the opposite direction of most breaking pitches

## What Makes a Screwball an Outlier

1. **Movement**: Moves in the opposite direction of other breaking pitches, breaking inward toward same-handed batters
2. **Deception**: The unusual movement can catch hitters off guard, especially if they’re expecting a more conventional pitch
3. **Rarity**: The screwball is seldom used in modern baseball, making it a rare weapon in a pitcher’s arsenal
4. **Arm Action**: Requires a unique arm action that can be taxing on the arm, contributing to its rarity

## MLB Pitchers with Elite Screwballs

The screwball is rare, but a few pitchers have mastered it:

1. **Carl Hubbell (Retired)**: A Hall of Fame pitcher famous for his screwball, earning the nickname "The Meal Ticket"
2. **Fernando Valenzuela (Retired)**: Known for his devastating screwball that helped him win the 1981 Cy Young Award
3. **Christy Mathewson (Retired)**: An early pioneer of the screwball, which he referred to as his "fadeaway"
4. **Mike Marshall (Retired)**: Won the 1974 Cy Young Award largely due to his screwball, which he threw frequently
5. **Luis Tiant (Retired)**: Featured a screwball as part of his varied pitch repertoire

## Advanced Metrics

Baseball Savant and other analytical tools offer insights into the effectiveness of screwballs:

- **Velocity**: Measured in miles per hour (mph)
- **Spin Rate**: Measured in revolutions per minute (RPM), often lower than other breaking pitches due to the pronation
- **Horizontal & Vertical Break**: Measured in inches, showing the unique inward and downward movement
- **Whiff Rate**: Percentage of swings that result in misses, often high due to the unexpected movement
- **Ground Ball Rate**: High percentage of ground balls, as the screwball's movement induces weak contact

## Types of Screwballs

1. **Traditional Screwball**: Thrown with moderate velocity and pronounced inward break
2. **Power Screwball**: Thrown harder, with less break but quicker movement
3. **Changeup Screwball**: Thrown slower, with more exaggerated movement, often used as a changeup

## Comparison to Other Pitches

- **Slower** than a fastball but often similar in speed to a changeup or curveball
- **Inward movement** sets it apart from sliders, curveballs, and other breaking pitches that move away from the arm side
- **Less common** than other breaking pitches, making it difficult for hitters to recognize and react to
- **Unique grip and pronation** make it different from other pitches, requiring a distinct technique

## Historical Note

The screwball has a storied history in baseball, dating back to the early 20th century. While it was once a more common pitch, it has become increasingly rare due to concerns about its impact on a pitcher’s arm health and the difficulty of mastering the pitch. Despite this, the screwball remains a fascinating and effective pitch for those who can throw it well, and it has played a significant role in the success of several legendary pitchers.
