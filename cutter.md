# Cutter (Cut Fastball)

The cutter, or cut fastball, is a pitch that combines elements of a fastball and a slider. It's known for its late, sharp break that moves away from same-handed batters and in on opposite-handed batters.

## Movement Profile

- Features late, sharp horizontal movement in the direction of the pitcher's glove side
- Has less vertical drop than a slider but more than a four-seam fastball
- Movement is typically 2-6 inches horizontally

## Velocity Ranges

- Major League average: 88-92 mph
- Elite velocity: 93+ mph
- Usually 2-5 mph slower than a pitcher's four-seam fastball

## Usage

- Often used to induce weak contact and break bats
- Effective against both same-sided and opposite-sided batters
- Used to combat the platoon advantage of opposite-handed hitters
- Can be thrown in any count due to its versatility

## Grip

- Similar to a four-seam fastball grip, but with the ball slightly off-center
- Pressure is applied with the middle finger along one of the seams
- The thumb is placed on the opposite seam for balance

## What Makes a Cutter an Outlier

1. Velocity: Cutters over 93 mph are considered elite
2. Late Break: Sharp, late movement that's difficult for batters to pick up
3. Spin Rate: Higher spin rates (2400+ RPM) can create more effective movement
4. Movement Differential: Significant difference in movement compared to the pitcher's fastball

## MLB Pitchers with Elite Cutters

According to Baseball Savant's recent data:

1. Kenley Jansen (BOS): Known for having one of the best cutters in MLB history
2. Yu Darvish (SD): Features a hard cutter with significant movement
3. Max Fried (ATL): Utilizes a cutter effectively to complement his other pitches
4. Corbin Burnes (MIL): Throws a high-velocity cutter with exceptional movement
5. James Karinchak (CLE): Has developed a devastating cutter in recent years

## Advanced Metrics

Baseball Savant provides several metrics to evaluate cutters:

- Velocity: Measured in miles per hour (mph)
- Horizontal Movement: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Vertical Movement: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Spin Rate: Measured in revolutions per minute (RPM)
- Whiff Rate: Percentage of swings that result in misses

Pitchers use these metrics to optimize their cutters for maximum effectiveness against both left-handed and right-handed batters.

## Comparison to Other Fastballs

- Slower than four-seam and two-seam fastballs
- More horizontal movement than four-seam fastballs
- Moves in the opposite direction of two-seam fastballs
- Often has a higher spin rate than two-seam fastballs
- Typically results in more weak contact and broken bats than other fastball variants

## Historical Note

The cutter gained prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with Mariano Rivera being widely credited for popularizing the pitch. Rivera's cutter is often considered one of the most dominant pitches in baseball history.
