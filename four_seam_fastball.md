# Four-Seam Fastball

The four-seam fastball is one of the most common and straightforward pitches in baseball. It's known for its velocity and relatively straight trajectory.

## Movement Profile

- Typically has the least movement of any pitch type
- Characterized by a small amount of "rise" or vertical movement due to backspin
- Minimal horizontal movement compared to other pitch types

## Velocity Ranges

- Major League average: 93-94 mph
- Elite velocity: 97+ mph
- Some outliers can reach 100+ mph

## Usage

- Often used as a "setup" pitch to establish the strike zone
- Frequently thrown in favorable counts or when behind in the count
- Can be effective up in the zone, especially against power hitters

## Grip

- Placed across the horseshoe seams, forming a "C" shape with the index and middle fingers
- Fingers are placed close together for maximum velocity
- Thumb is placed directly underneath for balance

## What Makes a Four-Seam Fastball an Outlier

1. Velocity: Fastballs over 97 mph are considered elite
2. Spin Rate: Higher spin rates (2400+ RPM) can create more "rise" effect
3. Vertical Movement: More rise than average can make the pitch harder to hit
4. Perceived Velocity: How fast the pitch appears to the batter due to the pitcher's extension

## MLB Pitchers with Elite Four-Seam Fastballs

According to Baseball Savant's 2024 data:

1. Ben Joyce (LAA): Recorded the fastest pitch of the season at 104.8 mph
2. Jacob deGrom (TEX): Known for combining elite velocity with pinpoint control
3. Gerrit Cole (NYY): Consistently ranks among the leaders in fastball spin rate
4. Spencer Strider (ATL): Combines high velocity with an exceptional spin rate
5. Shohei Ohtani (LAD): Showcases an impressive combination of velocity and movement

## Advanced Metrics

Baseball Savant provides several metrics to evaluate four-seam fastballs:

- Velocity: Measured in miles per hour (mph)
- Spin Rate: Measured in revolutions per minute (RPM)
- Active Spin: Percentage of spin contributing to movement
- Vertical Break: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Horizontal Break: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch

Pitchers can use these metrics to optimize their four-seam fastballs for maximum effectiveness.
