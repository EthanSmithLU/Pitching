# Changeup

The changeup is an off-speed pitch designed to look like a fastball but arrive much slower, disrupting the batter's timing. It's known for its deceptive arm action and movement profile.

## Movement Profile

- Features arm-side fade (moves away from opposite-handed batters)
- Has some downward movement, often described as "tumbling" action
- Movement can vary based on grip and arm action, but generally less sharp than breaking pitches

## Velocity Ranges

- Major League average: 83-86 mph
- Slower changeups: 78-82 mph
- Faster changeups: 87-90 mph

## Usage

- Often used to disrupt timing and induce weak contact
- Particularly effective against opposite-handed batters
- Can be thrown in any count, but especially useful when ahead or in full counts
- Used to complement fastballs and keep hitters off-balance

## Grip

- Circle changeup: Most common, forming a circle with thumb and index finger
- Palmball: Ball is gripped deeply in the palm
- Vulcan changeup: Split-finger grip with middle and ring fingers
- Straight change: Similar to fastball grip but held deeper in the hand

## What Makes a Changeup an Outlier

1. Velocity Differential: Greater speed difference from the pitcher's fastball (ideally 8-12 mph)
2. Movement: More horizontal fade and/or vertical drop than average
3. Arm Speed: Maintaining fastball arm speed for deception
4. Spin Rate: Lower spin rates can create more movement and deception

## MLB Pitchers with Elite Changeups

According to Baseball Savant's recent data:

1. Devin Williams (MIL): Known for his "Airbender" changeup with exceptional movement
2. Luis Castillo (SEA): Features a high-velocity changeup with significant fade
3. Cole Irvin (BAL): Utilizes a changeup with excellent vertical movement
4. Trevor Hoffman (Retired): Hall of Famer known for one of the best changeups in history
5. Chris Paddack (MIN): Throws a changeup with high spin rate and effective movement

## Advanced Metrics

Baseball Savant provides several metrics to evaluate changeups:

- Velocity: Measured in miles per hour (mph)
- Spin Rate: Measured in revolutions per minute (RPM)
- Horizontal Movement: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Vertical Movement: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Whiff Rate: Percentage of swings that result in misses
- Put Away Percentage: Rate at which the pitch results in a strikeout when thrown with two strikes

## Types of Changeups

1. Circle Change: Traditional grip, good combination of fade and drop
2. Palmball: More velocity separation, less movement
3. Vulcan Change: Similar to a splitter, with more drop
4. Straight Change: Relies more on velocity deception than movement

## Comparison to Other Off-Speed Pitches

- Generally faster than curveballs but slower than sliders
- More arm-side movement than most breaking pitches
- Often has lower spin rates compared to breaking pitches
- Relies more on deception and timing disruption than pure movement

## Historical Note

The changeup has been a crucial pitch in baseball for decades, with pitchers like Trevor Hoffman and Pedro Martinez showcasing its effectiveness. In recent years, analytics have helped pitchers optimize their changeups for maximum effectiveness, leading to variations like the "Airbender" popularized by Devin Williams.
