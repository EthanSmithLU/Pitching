# Curveball

The curveball is a breaking pitch known for its significant downward movement and slower velocity compared to fastballs. It's designed to deceive batters with its sharp break and change of speed.

## Movement Profile

- Features significant downward movement (drop)
- Has varying degrees of horizontal movement depending on the pitcher's arm angle
- 12-6 curveballs have mostly vertical drop, while slurve-type curves have more horizontal movement

## Velocity Ranges

- Major League average: 78-82 mph
- Slower curveballs: 70-77 mph
- Faster curveballs: 83-86 mph

## Usage

- Often used as a strikeout pitch
- Effective for changing eye levels and disrupting timing
- Can be thrown in any count, but particularly effective when ahead in the count
- Used to induce weak contact and ground balls

## Grip

- Commonly gripped with the middle finger along the bottom seam
- Index finger is placed next to the middle finger
- Thumb is placed on the opposite seam for balance
- Ball is released with a downward snap of the wrist

## What Makes a Curveball an Outlier

1. Spin Rate: Higher spin rates (2800+ RPM) can create more effective movement
2. Vertical Break: More drop than average (8+ inches of drop compared to average)
3. Velocity Differential: Greater speed difference from the pitcher's fastball
4. Spin Axis: A consistent spin axis can make the pitch more deceptive

## MLB Pitchers with Elite Curveballs

According to Baseball Savant's recent data:

1. Shane McClanahan (TB): Features a high-spin, sharp-breaking curveball
2. Clayton Kershaw (LAD): Known for his 12-6 curveball with significant drop
3. Charlie Morton (ATL): Throws a curveball with exceptional vertical movement
4. Zac Gallen (ARI): Utilizes a curveball with high spin rate and effective movement
5. Tyler Glasnow (TB): Combines high velocity with significant break on his curve

## Advanced Metrics

Baseball Savant provides several metrics to evaluate curveballs:

- Velocity: Measured in miles per hour (mph)
- Spin Rate: Measured in revolutions per minute (RPM)
- Vertical Break: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Horizontal Break: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Whiff Rate: Percentage of swings that result in misses

## Types of Curveballs

1. 12-6 Curveball: Drops straight down, like the hands of a clock from 12 to 6
2. 11-5 Curveball: Has both vertical drop and slight horizontal movement
3. Knuckle Curve: Thrown with a knuckle pressed against the ball, creating a sharper break
4. Slurve: Combination of slider and curve, with more horizontal movement than a typical curve

## Comparison to Other Breaking Pitches

- Slower than sliders and cutters
- More vertical movement than sliders
- Generally has a higher spin rate than changeups
- Typically has more total movement than any other pitch type

## Historical Note

The curveball has been a staple pitch in baseball for over a century. Some of the most famous curveballs in history include Sandy Koufax's 12-6 curve and Bert Blyleven's sharp-breaking curve, which helped define their Hall of Fame careers.
