# Splitter

The splitter, or split-finger fastball, is a deceptive pitch that drops sharply as it approaches the plate, often causing batters to swing over the top of it. It's slower than a fastball but has more downward movement, making it an effective pitch for inducing ground balls and strikeouts.

## Movement Profile

- Primarily features downward movement, sometimes with slight fading action
- The pitch appears to be a fastball out of the hand but drops significantly as it reaches the plate
- Typically breaks late, making it difficult for batters to adjust

## Velocity Ranges

- **Major League average**: 82-86 mph
- **Slower splitters**: 78-81 mph
- **Faster splitters**: 87-91 mph

## Usage

- Often used as a strikeout pitch, particularly effective against opposite-handed batters
- Effective for inducing weak contact, especially ground balls
- Can be thrown in any count but is particularly dangerous when ahead
- Useful in disrupting timing by changing speeds and eye levels

## Grip

- Gripped with the index and middle fingers spread wide apart, placing them on the outer seams of the ball
- The thumb is placed underneath the ball for stability
- Unlike a fastball, the pitch is thrown with less wrist action, allowing the ball to drop as it approaches the plate
- The wide grip reduces backspin, which contributes to the downward break

## What Makes a Splitter an Outlier

1. **Velocity**: A high-velocity splitter (above 87 mph) can be particularly deceptive
2. **Movement**: Sharp, late downward movement that drops off the table as it nears the plate
3. **Spin Rate**: Lower spin rates (typically below 1500 RPM) enhance the downward break
4. **Deception**: The ability to make the pitch look like a fastball before dropping sharply

## MLB Pitchers with Elite Splitters

According to Baseball Savant's recent data:

1. **Shohei Ohtani (LAA)**: Known for his devastating splitter with sharp, late movement
2. **Kevin Gausman (TOR)**: Features a splitter that generates high swing-and-miss rates
3. **Yu Darvish (SDP)**: Utilizes a splitter with excellent downward break, complementing his pitch arsenal
4. **Masahiro Tanaka (NYY)**: Former MLB pitcher known for his effective splitter, which generated a lot of ground balls
5. **Koji Uehara (Retired)**: Famous for his slow, yet deceptive splitter during his time in MLB

## Advanced Metrics

Baseball Savant provides several metrics to evaluate splitters:

- **Velocity**: Measured in miles per hour (mph)
- **Spin Rate**: Measured in revolutions per minute (RPM)
- **Vertical Break**: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- **Whiff Rate**: Percentage of swings that result in misses
- **Ground Ball Rate**: Percentage of balls put in play that result in ground balls

## Types of Splitters

1. **Traditional Splitter**: Focuses on sharp downward movement with moderate velocity
2. **Power Splitter**: Thrown harder, with velocity closer to that of a fastball, but with less movement
3. **Fade Splitter**: Features both downward and lateral movement, making it more difficult for batters to square up

## Comparison to Other Pitches

- **Slower** than a fastball but faster than a changeup
- **More downward movement** than a fastball or changeup
- **Less lateral movement** than a slider or curveball
- **Similar velocity** to a changeup but with more dramatic late movement

## Historical Note

The splitter gained popularity in the 1980s, with pitchers like Bruce Sutter and Roger Clemens using it as a primary weapon. The pitch became known for its effectiveness in generating strikeouts and ground balls, especially with the introduction of more advanced metrics that highlighted its value. Today, it remains a key pitch for many MLB pitchers.
