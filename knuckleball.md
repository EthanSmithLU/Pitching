# Knuckleball

The knuckleball is one of the most unique and unpredictable pitches in baseball. Thrown with little to no spin, it moves erratically as it approaches the plate, making it difficult for both the batter and catcher to predict its trajectory. The knuckleball is typically slower than other pitches, but its unpredictable movement makes it a formidable weapon.

## Movement Profile

- Features erratic, unpredictable movement in multiple directions
- The lack of spin causes the ball to "dance" or "flutter" as it approaches the plate
- Movement can vary from pitch to pitch, even when thrown by the same pitcher

## Velocity Ranges

- **Major League average**: 60-70 mph
- **Slower knuckleballs**: 50-59 mph
- **Faster knuckleballs**: 71-80 mph

## Usage

- Used as a primary pitch by dedicated knuckleball pitchers
- Effective for disrupting the timing of hitters due to its unpredictable movement
- Often used to induce weak contact, but can also generate swings-and-misses
- Difficult for catchers to handle, often leading to passed balls or wild pitches

## Grip

- Gripped with the fingernails or fingertips pressed into the seams of the ball
- The ball is held with the fingertips or knuckles, with the thumb supporting underneath
- Thrown with little to no wrist action, allowing the ball to leave the hand with minimal spin
- The goal is to create as little spin as possible, which leads to the erratic movement

## What Makes a Knuckleball an Outlier

1. **Spin Rate**: Extremely low spin rate (often under 100 RPM), leading to unpredictable movement
2. **Movement**: Erratic movement in multiple directions, making it difficult to predict
3. **Deception**: The pitch looks slow and hittable but is incredibly hard to square up due to its unpredictable path
4. **Effectiveness**: When thrown well, it can make even the best hitters look foolish

## MLB Pitchers with Elite Knuckleballs

Although rare, some pitchers have made a career out of the knuckleball:

1. **Tim Wakefield (Retired)**: A long-time MLB pitcher known for his effective knuckleball, which helped him have a lengthy career
2. **R.A. Dickey (Retired)**: Won the 2012 NL Cy Young Award, largely due to his dominant knuckleball
3. **Phil Niekro (Retired)**: A Hall of Famer who is considered one of the greatest knuckleballers in history
4. **Charlie Hough (Retired)**: Known for his reliable knuckleball over a 25-year career
5. **Tom Candiotti (Retired)**: Another successful knuckleballer with a long MLB career

## Advanced Metrics

Baseball Savant and other advanced metrics offer limited but insightful data on knuckleballs:

- **Velocity**: Measured in miles per hour (mph)
- **Spin Rate**: Measured in revolutions per minute (RPM), with knuckleballs typically having the lowest spin rates
- **Horizontal & Vertical Break**: Measured in inches, but can vary widely due to the unpredictable nature of the pitch
- **Whiff Rate**: Percentage of swings that result in misses
- **Hard-Hit Rate**: Percentage of batted balls with an exit velocity of 95 mph or higher, often lower for knuckleballs due to weak contact

## Types of Knuckleballs

1. **Traditional Knuckleball**: Thrown with the fingertips or knuckles, resulting in minimal spin and maximum unpredictability
2. **Hard Knuckleball**: Thrown with slightly more velocity, leading to quicker movement but still with erratic behavior
3. **Soft Knuckleball**: Thrown slower with a focus on maximum movement, often leading to more dramatic "dancing" action

## Comparison to Other Pitches

- **Slower** than most other pitches, including fastballs, sliders, and changeups
- **Unpredictable movement** makes it different from other pitches that follow a more consistent path
- **More difficult to control** compared to standard pitches, leading to a higher likelihood of walks or wild pitches
- **Unique grip and release** compared to other pitches, requiring a different skill set to master

## Historical Note

The knuckleball has been a part of baseball for over a century, with pioneers like Eddie Cicotte and Hoyt Wilhelm making the pitch famous. Despite its effectiveness, the knuckleball is rarely used today due to its difficulty to master and the challenge it presents to catchers. However, when executed well, it remains one of the most baffling and effective pitches in baseball.
