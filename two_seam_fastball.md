# Two-Seam Fastball

The two-seam fastball, also known as a sinker, is a variation of the fastball that trades some velocity for increased movement, particularly arm-side run and sink.

## Movement Profile

- Characterized by arm-side run (horizontal movement towards the pitching-arm side)
- Features more downward movement (sink) compared to a four-seam fastball
- Generally has more overall movement but less "rise" than a four-seamer

## Velocity Ranges

- Major League average: 92-93 mph (slightly slower than four-seamers)
- Elite velocity: 96+ mph
- Typically 1-3 mph slower than a pitcher's four-seam fastball

## Usage

- Often used to induce ground balls
- Effective against same-handed batters (righty vs. righty or lefty vs. lefty)
- Frequently employed when trying to get a double play
- Used as a complement to four-seam fastballs to change eye levels and disrupt timing

## Grip

- Placed along the two seams where they are closest together
- Fingers are placed slightly farther apart than on a four-seamer
- Pressure applied with the index and middle fingers to create movement

## What Makes a Two-Seam Fastball an Outlier

1. Velocity: Two-seamers over 96 mph are considered elite
2. Horizontal Movement: More arm-side run than average (10+ inches)
3. Vertical Movement: More sink than average (5+ inches of drop compared to average)
4. Spin Rate: Generally lower than four-seamers, but elite two-seamers can have high spin efficiency

## MLB Pitchers with Elite Two-Seam Fastballs



According to Baseball Savant's recent data:

1. Zack Greinke (KC): Known for exceptional movement and command
2. Sandy Alcantara (MIA): Combines high velocity with significant movement
3. Logan Webb (SF): Features one of the best sinking two-seamers in the game
4. Framber Valdez (HOU): Utilizes a heavy sinker to induce ground balls
5. Luis Castillo (SEA): Throws a high-velocity two-seamer with significant arm-side run

## Advanced Metrics

Baseball Savant provides several metrics to evaluate two-seam fastballs:

- Velocity: Measured in miles per hour (mph)
- Horizontal Movement: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Vertical Movement: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Spin Rate: Measured in revolutions per minute (RPM)
- Induced Vertical Break (IVB): Measures the amount of "rise" or "sink" on the pitch

Pitchers often use these metrics to refine their two-seam fastballs for optimal ground ball rates and weak contact.

## Comparison to Four-Seam Fastball

- Generally 1-3 mph slower than four-seamers
- More horizontal movement (arm-side run)
- More vertical drop (sink)
- Often has a lower spin rate
- Typically results in more ground balls and fewer swings and misses
