# Slider

The slider is a breaking pitch that combines speed and movement, typically moving laterally and downward. It's faster than a curveball but with less overall movement, making it a popular strikeout pitch.

## Movement Profile

- Features a combination of lateral and downward movement
- Moves away from same-handed batters and in on opposite-handed batters
- Generally has a shorter, later break compared to curveballs

## Velocity Ranges

- Major League average: 84-88 mph
- Slower sliders: 79-83 mph
- Faster sliders: 89-93 mph (sometimes called "power sliders")

## Usage

- Often used as a strikeout pitch, especially against same-handed batters
- Effective for inducing weak contact and swings-and-misses
- Can be thrown in any count, but particularly effective when ahead
- Used to change eye levels and disrupt timing

## Grip

- Typically gripped off-center with the index and middle fingers close together
- Pressure applied with the middle finger along the outer seam
- Thumb placed on the opposite seam for balance
- Released with a slight twist of the wrist, creating spin

## What Makes a Slider an Outlier

1. Velocity: Sliders over 90 mph are considered "power sliders"
2. Spin Rate: Higher spin rates (2600+ RPM) can create more effective movement
3. Break: More total movement (combination of horizontal and vertical) than average
4. Late Break: Sharp, late movement that's difficult for batters to pick up

## MLB Pitchers with Elite Sliders

According to Baseball Savant's recent data:

1. Jacob deGrom (TEX): Throws a high-velocity slider with exceptional movement
2. Max Scherzer (NYM): Features a sharp-breaking slider with high spin rate
3. Corbin Burnes (MIL): Utilizes a cutter-slider hybrid with significant movement
4. Edwin Diaz (NYM): Known for his devastating high-velocity slider
5. Chris Sale (BOS): Throws a sweeping slider that's particularly effective against lefties

## Advanced Metrics

Baseball Savant provides several metrics to evaluate sliders:

- Velocity: Measured in miles per hour (mph)
- Spin Rate: Measured in revolutions per minute (RPM)
- Horizontal Break: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Vertical Break: Measured in inches, compared to a theoretical spinless pitch
- Whiff Rate: Percentage of swings that result in misses
- Put Away Percentage: Rate at which the pitch results in a strikeout when thrown with two strikes

## Types of Sliders

1. Traditional Slider: Combines moderate velocity with sharp break
2. Power Slider: Higher velocity (89+ mph) with slightly less break
3. Sweeper: Features more horizontal movement and less velocity
4. Gyro Slider: Has less overall movement but can be deceptive due to its spin

## Comparison to Other Breaking Pitches

- Faster than curveballs but slower than cutters
- Less overall movement than curveballs
- More lateral movement than cutters
- Generally has a higher whiff rate than other breaking pitches

## Historical Note

The slider gained prominence in the mid-20th century, with pitchers like Steve Carlton and Bob Gibson featuring devastating versions of the pitch. In recent years, the emergence of "power sliders" and analytical data has led to increased usage and effectiveness of the pitch across MLB.
